# Shop-Landing
 
 It is an e-commerce website that creates landing pages for each product, which are customized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views. The site collects data about customers and visitors, generating reports that help in creating effective advertising campaigns and targeting. This is the first version of the project, which includes landing pages. It allows for the creation of components in different shapes that can be reused in various places throughout the site as needed. Components within a section can also be reused, and the pages created can serve as landing pages. Each component contains a variety of shapes that can be selected based on demand. Currently, we are working on expanding the selection of shapes that can be used in landing pages to ensure they are complete and compatible with mobile, tablet, and desktop views. We are still working on the first version and have not finished its development yet.
